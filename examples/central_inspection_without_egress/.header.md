# AWS Network Firewall Module - Centralized Inspection VPC in a Hub and Spoke architecture with AWS Transit Gateway

This example shows the creation of a centralized Inspection VPC in a Hub and Spoke architecture with AWS Transit Gateway, with the idea of managing the traffic inspection at scale (East/West). The Inspection VPC is created only with AWS Transit Gateway ENIs and the firewall endpoints. The image below shows an example of the architecture, routing configuration, and traffic flow.
