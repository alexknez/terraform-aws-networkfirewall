# AWS Network Firewall Module - Single VPC

This example builds AWS Network Firewall in a single VPC to inspect any ingress/egress traffic - distributed inspection model. The firewall endpoints are placed in subnets between the Internet gateway (IGW) and the public subnets (where you can place the Elastic Load Balancers and NAT gateways). The image below shows an example of the architecture, routing configuration, and traffic flow.

The AWS Region used in the example is **us-east-2 (Ohio)**, and the instances placed in the "protected" subnets can ping anything in the Internet and access any HTTPS domain to *.amazon.com - other traffic is dropped.

## Prerequisites

* An AWS account with an IAM user with the appropriate permissions
* Terraform installed

## Code Principles

* Writing DRY (Do No Repeat Yourself) code using a modular design pattern

## Usage

* Clone the repository
* Edit the *variables.tf* file in the project root directory

**Note** EC2 instances, VPC endpoints, and Network Firewall endpoints will be deployted in all the Availability Zones used in the example (*var.vpc.number_azs*). By default, the number of AZs used is 2 to follow best practices. Take that into account when doing tests from a cost perspective.
