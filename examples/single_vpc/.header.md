# AWS Network Firewall Module - Single VPC

This example builds AWS Network Firewall in a single VPC to inspect any ingress/egress traffic - distributed inspection model. 

* Outside of the Network Firewall module:
  * Firewall policies - in `policy.tf`
  * Amazon VPC with 3 subnet types (firewall, protected, and private)
* Created by the Network Firewall mdodule:
  * AWS Network Firewall resource.
  * Routing to the firewall endpoints - to inspect traffic between the Internet gateway and the protected subnets)

The AWS Region used in the example is **us-east-2 (Ohio)**.

## Prerequisites

* An AWS account with an IAM user with the appropriate permissions
* Terraform installed

## Code Principles

* Writing DRY (Do No Repeat Yourself) code using a modular design pattern

## Usage

* Clone the repository
* Edit the *variables.tf* file in the project root directory

**Note** Network Firewall endpoints will be deployted in all the Availability Zones used in the example (*var.vpc.number_azs*). By default, the number of AZs used is 2 to follow best practices. Take that into account when doing tests from a cost perspective.
