# AWS Network Firewall Module - Centralized Inspection VPC (with egress traffic) in a Hub and Spoke architecture with AWS Transit Gateway

This example shows the creation of a centralized Inspection VPC in a Hub and Spoke architecture with AWS Transit Gateway, with the idea of managing the traffic inspection at scale (East/West and North/South). This example creates the following resources:

* Outside of the Network Firewall module:
  * Firewall policies - in `policy.tf`
  * AWS Transit Gateway.
  * Inspection VPC, attached to the Transit Gateway, and with NAT gateways (to allow egress traffic).
  * Routing in the Inspection VPC to route traffic from the NAT gateways to the Internet (0.0.0.0/0), and from the inspection subnets to the Transit Gateway (network's supernet defined in `variables.tf`).
* Created by the Network Firewall mdodule:
  * AWS Network Firewall resource.
  * Routing to the firewall endpoints (from the transit_gateway and public subnets).

The AWS Region used in the example is **eu-west-1 (Ireland)**.

## Prerequisites

* An AWS account with an IAM user with the appropriate permissions
* Terraform installed

## Code Principles

* Writing DRY (Do No Repeat Yourself) code using a modular design pattern

## Usage

* Clone the repository
* Edit the *variables.tf* file in the project root directory

**Note** Network Firewall endpoints will be deployed in all the Availability Zones used in the example (*var.inspection_vpc.number_azs*). By default, the number of AZs used is 2 to follow best practices. Take that into account when doing tests from a cost perspective.
