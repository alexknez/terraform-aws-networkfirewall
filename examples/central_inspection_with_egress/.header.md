# AWS Network Firewall Module - Centralized Inspection VPC (with egress traffic) in a Hub and Spoke architecture with AWS Transit Gateway

This example shows the creation of a centralized Inspection VPC in a Hub and Spoke architecture with AWS Transit Gateway, with the idea of managing the traffic inspection at scale (East/West and North/South). The Inspection VPC is created with AWS Transit Gateway ENIs, firewall endpoints, and NAT gateways (allowing a centralized egress point). The image below shows an example of the architecture, routing configuration, and traffic flow.
