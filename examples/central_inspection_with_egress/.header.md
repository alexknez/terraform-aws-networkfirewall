# AWS Network Firewall Module - Centralized Inspection VPC (with egress traffic) in a Hub and Spoke architecture with AWS Transit Gateway

This example shows the creation of a centralized Inspection VPC in a Hub and Spoke architecture with AWS Transit Gateway, with the idea of managing the traffic inspection at scale (East/West and North/South). The Inspection VPC is created with AWS Transit Gateway ENIs, firewall endpoints, and NAT gateways (allowing a centralized egress point). The image below shows an example of the architecture, routing configuration, and traffic flow.

The AWS Region used in the example is **eu-west-1 (Ireland)**, creating 2 Spoke VPCs and 1 Inspection VPC (with egress). To test that the traffic is sent via the AWS Network Firewall, the firewall policy (in the *firewall.tf* policy file) allows ICMP traffic between the Spoke VPCs (but not to the Internet) and HTTPS traffic to any *.amazon.com domain.

## Prerequisites

* An AWS account with an IAM user with the appropriate permissions
* Terraform installed

## Code Principles

* Writing DRY (Do No Repeat Yourself) code using a modular design pattern

## Usage

* Clone the repository
* Edit the *variables.tf* file in the project root directory

**Note** EC2 instances, VPC endpoints, and Network Firewall endpoints will be deployted in all the Availability Zones used in the example (*var.vpc.number_azs*). By default, the number of AZs used is 2 to follow best practices. Take that into account when doing tests from a cost perspective.
