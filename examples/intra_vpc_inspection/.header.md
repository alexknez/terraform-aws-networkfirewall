# AWS Network Firewall Module - Intra-VPC Inspection

This example builds AWS Network Firewall in a single VPC to perform intra-VPC inspection between its subnets. The image below shows an example of the architecture, routing configuration, and traffic flow.

The AWS Region used in the example is **eu-west-2 (London)**. Five different subnet types are created (inspection, endpoints, private1, private2, and private3). The first two subnet types are used to place the firewall endpoints from AWS Network Firewall (*inspection*) and the SSM VPC endpoints to access the EC2 instances (*endpoints*). The other three subnet types are used to place EC2 instances. To test the firewall policy, the following traffic will be allowed (ICMP):

* EC2 instances between subnets *private1* and *private2*.
* EC2 instances between subnets *private2* and *private3*.
* Traffic between subnets *private1* and *private3* will be blocked.

You can check the firewall policy applied in the *policy.tf* file.

## Prerequisites

* An AWS account with an IAM user with the appropriate permissions
* Terraform installed

## Code Principles

* Writing DRY (Do No Repeat Yourself) code using a modular design pattern

## Usage

* Clone the repository
* Edit the *variables.tf* file in the project root directory

**Note** EC2 instances, VPC endpoints, and Network Firewall endpoints will be deployted in all the Availability Zones used in the example (*var.vpc.number_azs*). By default, the number of AZs used is 2 to follow best practices. Take that into account when doing tests from a cost perspective.
