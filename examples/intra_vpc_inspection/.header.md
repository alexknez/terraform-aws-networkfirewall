# AWS Network Firewall Module - Intra-VPC Inspection

This example builds AWS Network Firewall in a single VPC to perform intra-VPC inspection between its subnets. The image below shows an example of the architecture, routing configuration, and traffic flow.

You can check the firewall policy applied in the *policy.tf* file.

## Prerequisites

* An AWS account with an IAM user with the appropriate permissions
* Terraform installed

## Code Principles

* Writing DRY (Do No Repeat Yourself) code using a modular design pattern

## Usage

* Clone the repository
* Edit the *variables.tf* file in the project root directory

**Note** Network Firewall endpoints will be deployted in all the Availability Zones used in the example (*var.vpc.number_azs*). By default, the number of AZs used is 2 to follow best practices. Take that into account when doing tests from a cost perspective.
