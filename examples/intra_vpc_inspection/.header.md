# AWS Network Firewall Module - Intra-VPC Inspection

This example builds AWS Network Firewall in a single VPC to perform intra-VPC inspection between its subnets. This example creates the following resources:

* Outside of the Network Firewall module:
  * Firewall policies - in `policy.tf`
  * Amazon VPC with several subnets (3 private subnets, 1 inspection subnet, 1 endpoints subnet)
* Created by the Network Firewall mdodule:
  * AWS Network Firewall resource.
  * Routing to the firewall endpoints - to inspect traffic between the private subnets.

The AWS Region used in the example is **eu-west-2 (London)**.

## Prerequisites

* An AWS account with an IAM user with the appropriate permissions
* Terraform installed

## Code Principles

* Writing DRY (Do No Repeat Yourself) code using a modular design pattern

## Usage

* Clone the repository
* Edit the *variables.tf* file in the project root directory

**Note** Network Firewall endpoints will be deployted in all the Availability Zones used in the example (*var.vpc.number_azs*). By default, the number of AZs used is 2 to follow best practices. Take that into account when doing tests from a cost perspective.
